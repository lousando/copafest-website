					<h2>Volunteer Information:</h2>
					<p>
						We can't have enough help. XYLs and kids are welcome to
						help out. We need help in these areas:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Gatekeepers:</b> We need four people, working in
							two three-hour shifts of two people each, to take
							the money and issue wristbands.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Raffle Ticket Sellers:</b> We need at least four
							people walking the crowd selling raffle tickets.
							Raffle tickets have been our largest source of
							income in the past and getting them sold means money
							for the club. We have close to a thousand dollars of
							expense to cover before we realize any profit.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Booth Representatives:</b> We need another four
							people to sit the booth, in shifts, pass out
							information, answer questions, and sell raffle
							tickets.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Sign Makers:</b> If someone in your family has
							some artistic talent and would like to make signs
							for the various seminars, etc., let me know. We will
							provide the materials.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Setup and take down:</b> Setup with start at 4:30
							AM when the tailgaters arrive and breakdown will
							happen after 1:00 PM. Any number of hands to help
							load the trailer and the truck will be a help.
						</li>
					</ul>
