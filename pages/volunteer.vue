			Club Volunteer Information We can't have enough help. XYLs and kids
			are welcome to help out. We need help in these areas:
		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Gatekeepers: We need four people, working in two three-hour
				shifts of two people each, to take the money and issue
				wristbands.
			</li>
			<li>
				Raffle Ticket Sellers. We need at least four people walking the
				crowd selling raffle tickets. Raffle tickets have been our
				largest source of income in the past and getting them sold means
				money for the club. We have close to a thousand dollars of
				expense to cover before we realize any profit.
			</li>
			<li>
				Booth Representatives: We need another four people to sit the
				booth, in shifts, pass out information, answer questions, and
				sell raffle tickets.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sign Makers. If someone in your family has some artistic talent
				and would like to make signs for the various seminars, etc., let
				me know. We will provide the materials.
			</li>
			<li>
				Setup and take down. Setup with start at 4:30 AM when the
				tailgaters arrive and breakdown will happen after 1:00 PM. Any
				number of hands to help load the trailer and the truck will be a
				help.
			</li>
		</ul>
